							<p class="text-justify text-white">Back in 2017 ordering food via an app was not a common practice especially in the NE Zone considering as the chicken neck corridor.The idea was to take the entire restaurant experience right at the customers pocket, to build a brand which will become the goto place to order delicious fusion food at the doorstep. Hence, giving birth to One stop Kitchen; North East India’s first cloud kitchen. Stepping in as a mere social page in April 2017 by Rahul Hazarika to Abhilash Baruah joining and co-founding OSK Food & Technology Pvt. Ltd. in October 2019; to become the first Food Tech start-up from the region to be VC (Venture Capital) funded in 2020. OSK Food & Technology Pvt. Ltd. was incubated by an Assam startup The Nest (An Initiative by Assam Govt. & IIM Calcutta), and is also the first few food tech start-up to be registered under Start-up India from the entire region.</p>
